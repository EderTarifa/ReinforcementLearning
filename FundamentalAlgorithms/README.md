# Reinforcemente Learning fundamental algorithm

This project implement the 3 most fundamental algorithms used in Reinforcement Learning. I solve the Maze problem with each of them and perform and analysis research. The three algorithms are:
- Dynamic Programming
- Monte-Carlo
- Temporal Difference

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable).
2. **Install dependencies**: Use the following command to install the required packages.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
