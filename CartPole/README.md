# DQN Cart Pole Reinforcement Learning

This project uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to train an agent to balance a pole on a cart in the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym. The implementation explores various configurations and hyperparameters to improve the agent's performance and training efficiency.
